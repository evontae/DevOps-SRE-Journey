## Project Table for DevOps/SRE Professional Development

| **Skill Area**                     | **Project Description**                                                                                                                           |
|------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1. Foundation in DevOps Basics     | Develop a personal website hosted on a Raspberry Pi using Linux for setup, Git for version control, Ansible for automation tasks, and Python scripts for dynamic content. |
| 2. Mastering Docker and Containerization | Create a microservices architecture for a small application where each service runs in its own Docker container. Use Docker Compose for orchestration and Python scripts to automate common management tasks. |
| 3. Automation with Ansible         | Automate the deployment of a multi-tier web application across different environments using Ansible. This includes configuration of web servers, database servers, and load balancers. |
| 4. Infrastructure as Code with Terraform | Provision and manage a complete cloud environment on AWS or Azure using Terraform. This environment should include virtual machines, networking, storage, and security configurations. |
| 5. Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD) | Set up a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions that builds, tests, and deploys a multi-container application using Docker and Kubernetes. Incorporate automated security scans and performance testing. |
| 6. Cloud Proficiency with Azure    | Build a scalable web application hosted on Azure, utilizing Azure Functions for serverless components, and manage it using Azure CLI tools. Include automated deployment scripts and use Python for backend logic. |
| 7. Kubernetes for Orchestration    | Deploy and manage a complex application with stateful and stateless services on a Kubernetes cluster. Include auto-scaling, load balancing, and self-healing capabilities. |
| 8. Monitoring and Observability    | Implement a full-stack monitoring solution using Prometheus, Grafana, and the ELK Stack. This should monitor your Kubernetes-deployed applications and provide actionable insights through custom dashboards. |
| 9. Integrating ML/AI with DevOps   | Automate an aspect of your CI/CD pipeline using machine learning models hosted on Azure ML, such as predictive analytics for deployment success or anomaly detection in application logs. |
| 10. DevSecOps and Security Practices | Integrate security at every stage of your CI/CD pipeline. This includes automatic vulnerability scanning of Docker containers, compliance checks with Ansible, and secure coding practices in the build process. |
| 11. Chaos Engineering              | Conduct chaos experiments on your Kubernetes environment to test the resilience of your system. Use tools like Chaos Monkey to introduce failures and measure recovery processes. |
| 12. Leadership and Soft Skills     | Lead a virtual team in a simulated project management scenario. Use role-playing to handle communications, conflict resolution, and strategic decision-making. This project could be coordinated using project management tools like Jira or Asana. |

Each project is aligned with the technical and leadership skills necessary for a senior DevOps/SRE role. These projects are designed to be hands-on and challenging, providing you with real-world experience and demonstrable skills.
