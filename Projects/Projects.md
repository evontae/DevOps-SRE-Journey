### 2. Mastering Docker and Containerization
**Objective:** Create a microservices architecture for a web application.  
**Technologies:** Docker, Docker Compose, Python  
**Description:**  
Design and implement a microservices architecture where each service operates within its own Docker container. Setup Docker Compose for orchestration and use Python scripts to automate routine Docker management tasks.

### 3. Automation with Ansible
**Objective:** Automate deployment of a multi-tier web application.  
**Technologies:** Ansible  
**Description:**  
Use Ansible to automate the deployment of a complex, multi-tier web application across different environments. Configure playbooks for web servers, database servers, and load balancers for high availability and scalability.

### 4. Infrastructure as Code with Terraform
**Objective:** Provision and manage a complete cloud infrastructure.  
**Technologies:** Terraform, AWS/Azure  
**Description:**  
Codify infrastructure using Terraform to set up virtual machines, networking configurations, load balancers, and storage solutions on AWS or Azure, emphasizing the principles of Infrastructure as Code.

### 5. Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD)
**Objective:** Set up a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions.  
**Technologies:** GitHub Actions, Docker, Kubernetes  
**Description:**  
Develop a CI/CD pipeline that automates building, testing, and deployment phases of a multi-container Docker application. Integrate security scans and performance testing within the pipeline.

### 6. Cloud Proficiency with Azure
**Objective:** Build and deploy a scalable web application on Azure.  
**Technologies:** Azure, Azure Functions, Azure CLI, Python  
**Description:**  
Utilize Azure Functions for serverless computing within a scalable web application, manage resources using Azure CLI, and implement Python scripts for backend logic.

### 7. Kubernetes for Orchestration
**Objective:** Manage a complex application using Kubernetes.  
**Technologies:** Kubernetes  
**Description:**  
Deploy and manage a robust application with Kubernetes, focusing on container orchestration, auto-scaling, load balancing, and self-healing capabilities.

### 8. Monitoring and Observability
**Objective:** Implement a full-stack monitoring solution.  
**Technologies:** Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack  
**Description:**  
Use Prometheus for metrics collection, Grafana for data visualization, and the ELK Stack for log management, providing real-time insights into application performance.

### 9. Integrating ML/AI with DevOps
**Objective:** Enhance CI/CD pipelines with machine learning models.  
**Technologies:** Azure Machine Learning  
**Description:**  
Integrate Azure Machine Learning models into the CI/CD pipeline to predict deployment success and detect anomalies in application logs.

### 10. DevSecOps and Security Practices
**Objective:** Integrate security into the DevOps lifecycle.  
**Technologies:** Docker, Ansible  
**Description:**  
Incorporate security practices into the CI/CD pipeline, including vulnerability scans of Docker containers and compliance checks with Ansible.

### 11. Chaos Engineering
**Objective:** Conduct chaos experiments on Kubernetes environments.  
**Technologies:** Kubernetes, Chaos Monkey  
**Description:**  
Systematically introduce failures using Chaos Monkey to test system resilience and improve robustness.

### 12. Leadership and Soft Skills
**Objective:** Develop leadership skills in project management.  
**Technologies:** Jira, Asana  
**Description:**  
Lead a virtual team in a simulated project management scenario, focusing on communications, conflict resolution, and strategic decision-making.
