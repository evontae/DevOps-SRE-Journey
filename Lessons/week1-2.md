### Lesson Plan: Introduction to Linux Command Line

#### Weeks 1-2: Getting Started with Linux

### Week 1: Basic Linux Commands

#### Objective:

Familiarize yourself with the basic command line interface of Linux, focusing on file navigation and simple operations.

### Reading Assignments:

-   "The Linux Command Line" by William Shotts, Chapters 1-3:
    -   Chapter 1: Introduction to the command line
    -   Chapter 2: Basic navigation
    -   Chapter 3: More about files

### Video Tutorials:

-   [Linux Command Line Basics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxuRxtrO2Ag) - This tutorial covers fundamental operations within the Linux terminal, such as navigating the file system and manipulating files.

### Practical Exercises:

1.  Navigating the File System:

    -   Learn and practice using `cd`, `ls`, and `pwd` to explore the filesystem.
    -   Snippet:

        bash

        Copy code

        `pwd  # Display the current directory path
        ls   # List directory contents
        cd /path/to/directory  # Change directory`

2.  Creating and Managing Files:

    -   Use commands like `touch`, `mkdir`, `cp`, `mv`, and `rm` to manage files and directories.
    -   Snippet:

        bash

        Copy code

        `mkdir MyDocuments  # Create a new directory
        touch MyDocuments/newfile.txt  # Create a new file inside MyDocuments`

#### Week 2: Intermediate Command Line Tools

#### Objective:

Expand your command-line knowledge to include file permissions, basic scripting, and data manipulation commands.

### Reading Assignments:

-   Continue with "The Linux Command Line" by William Shotts, Chapters 4-6:
    -   Chapter 4: Permissions
    -   Chapter 5: Redirections
    -   Chapter 6: Seeing the world as the shell sees it

### Video Tutorials:

-   [Understanding File Permissions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7BufAVwDiM) - Explains how Linux file permissions work and how to modify them using `chmod`.

### Practical Exercises:

1.  Managing File Permissions:

    -   Change file permissions using `chmod`, and understand the implications of different settings.
    -   Snippet:

        bash

        Copy code

        `chmod 755 newfile.txt  # Change permissions to read, write, and execute for owner, and read and execute for others`

2.  Redirection and Searching:

    -   Practice redirecting output to files, combining commands with pipes, and searching within files using `grep`.
    -   Snippet:

        bash

        Copy code

        `grep 'keyword' filename.txt > results.txt  # Search for 'keyword' in 'filename.txt' and redirect output to 'results.txt'`

### Resources for Learning:

-   Linux Command Line Documentation: [Link](http://linuxcommand.org/)
-   Additional practical exercises available on platforms like Codecademy or freeCodeCamp for interactive learning.

### Submission Guidelines:

-   Document your command usage and scripts used for exercises in a Markdown file in your GitHub repository under `Linux/Basics`.
-   Include explanations of what each command or script does, along with any output or results.

### Review and Continuous Improvement:

-   Reflect on your progress with these commands and scripts, noting any difficulties or new insights.
-   Regularly update your documentation to reflect new learnings and improvements in your command line proficiency.
