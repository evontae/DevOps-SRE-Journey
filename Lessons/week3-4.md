### Lesson Plan: Python for Automation

#### Week 3-4: Python Basics and System Automation

#### Objective:

Develop a solid foundation in Python programming with a focus on automating routine system administration tasks.

#### Reading Assignments:

-   "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python" by Al Sweigart:
    -   Chapters 1-4: Covering the basics of Python including variables, basic data types, control structures, and simple I/O operations.

#### Practical Exercises:

1.  Python Basics:

    -   Write a Python script that outputs the current date and time.
    -   Create a simple calculator that can add, subtract, multiply, and divide, handling user input and output.
2.  File Operations:

    -   Write a script that reads a log file and counts the number of occurrences of different error levels (INFO, WARNING, ERROR).
3.  System Monitoring:

    -   Develop a Python script that checks the current disk usage and sends an alert (prints a message) if it exceeds 80% capacity.

#### Mini Project:

-   System Health Dashboard:
    -   Create a Python script that aggregates system health information (CPU load, disk usage, memory usage) and writes it to an output file formatted for easy reading. Optionally, extend this script to run at regular intervals using a scheduling tool like `cron`.

#### Resources:

-   Official Python Documentation: <https://docs.python.org/3/>
-   Python Tutorials for specific tasks related to system administration.

#### Submission Guidelines:

-   Upload all scripts to your GitHub repository in a new folder named `/Practice/Python`.
-   Include comments in your scripts to explain the purpose and functionality of each part.
-   Update your `README.md` in the Python folder detailing what each script does and how to run them.

#### Review and Feedback:

-   Once completed, review each script to ensure it functions as expected.
-   Reflect on what was challenging and how you solved those challenges.
-   Provide a link to the GitHub repository for feedback on your implementation and coding style.

This lesson plan is designed to gradually build your Python skills, starting with simple tasks and moving towards more complex system automation scripts. It's structured to ensure you get practical experience with Python in scenarios typical for DevOps environments.
